# jsimpleai
Java framework for solving classical AI search problems using DFS, BFS, A* Search, and Iterative Deepening.

I created this while working on class assignments of 'Introduction to AI' by Prof. Daniel Tauritz at Missouri S&T

Implemented sample solvers for travelling salesman, graph bisection, and an online puzzle [frog leap](http://www.justriddlesandmore.com/frogleap.html).

Output for frog leap shows that there are two possible solutions, with various state transitions.
